# Slider-Game

I heard somewhere that only virgins use IDEs so im trying to learn C++ linking and building process by making SFML project without Visual Studio only using g++ like a real chad.

As far as i know, to build and run the program just navigate to project and type `make` in your terminal.

[+] I made player slider movement limited so it can't leave the screen.\
[+] I added background sprite and texture (that i have stolen from somewhere on the internet)
